## Hello!

My name is Nikola Misetic and I am a senior at the George Washington University. I am a political science major and with both journalism and history minors. My previous work experiences include internships on both Capitol Hill and the NYC Office of the Mayor. Politics has always been a passion of mine, and I am always striving to improve both myself and the work that I do.

## Work Examples:

### Census Analysis

During my senior fall semester, I took a journalism class that focused on how to use Github and RStudio. These two skills are essential for reporting data in real time and creating my own webpages. One of the things we learned to do was create maps that illustrate differences in data geographically. Using that knowledge, I will illustrate the median income of each county in the state in Illinois.

### Academic Paper

During my time at GW, I had the privilege studying the intricacies of the executive branch. With this knowledge, I wrote a paper on the Environmental Protection Agency and its impact on U.S. oil policy. In this paper, I discussed several facets of this issue, including the politics of oil and the regulatory process. I was also able to interview Larry Weinstock, a Program Innovation Coordinator at the EPA.

### Journalism Paper

One of the first journalism classes I took at GW was Introduction to News Writing. In this class, I learned the fundamentals as well as very important tips and tricks I still use today. One of the most memorable aspects of that class was the bi-weekly reporting assignment, where I got to interview people, hunt down facts, and report my findings to my classmates. My favorite news assignment from that class was when I wrote about how the Covid-19 pandemic affected local movie theaters where I live and the theater industry in general.
